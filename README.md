**Project: E-commerce Website**

**Description:**
Develop a basic e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to the cart, proceed to checkout, and make purchases.

**Features:**
1. **Product Catalog:** Display a list of products with details like name, description, price, and images.
2. **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login functionality to allow users to create accounts, login, and manage their profiles.
3. **Shopping Cart:** Allow users to add products to their shopping cart, update quantities, and remove items.
4. **Checkout Process:** Implement a checkout process where users can enter shipping details, select shipping options, and make payments.
5. **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle payment processing securely.
6. **Order Management:** Allow users to view their order history and track the status of their orders.
7. **Search and Filtering:** Implement search functionality to allow users to search for products by name or category. Also, include filtering options to narrow down product listings.

**Tech Stack:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB or any other database of choice
- JWT for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing

**Additional Challenges:**
1. Implement product reviews and ratings functionality to allow users to leave feedback on products.
2. Incorporate pagination for product listings to improve performance and user experience.
3. Integrate third-party APIs for features like product recommendations, shipping rate calculation, or social media sharing.
4. Add user wishlist functionality to allow users to save products for future purchase.
5. Implement email notifications for order confirmation, shipping updates, and promotional offers.

This project will provide junior developers with practical experience in building a full-stack e-commerce website, covering key aspects such as user authentication, product management, shopping cart functionality, and payment processing.
